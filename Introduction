Univeristy's Timetable Manager & Availability Checker Application.

The application, “Youni & Friends”, simplifies timetabling and integrates our everyday
university experience with our personal life. The app achieves this by creating a platform
where Sydney University’s students can find the optimal timetable that meets their
personal wants and needs as well as finding time for social interactions. Users can enter
their university units and connect with up to 3 friends and the app will then automatically
generate a timetable that fulfills these factors. There are features available for users to
customise their timetables, such as allocating break times for eating and study sessions,
and colour coding to quickly differentiate units, enhancing organisation. This app benefits
users by improving time management, increasing social interactions, and allowing for
better coordination among university students, resulting in a more productive day. The
tools that were incorporated in this project, including Figma and UML diagrams for
designing, a priority table for functions and features documentation, and a database
software to store the information. In the following points, the Software Development Life
Cycle framework of the project is further discussed.
